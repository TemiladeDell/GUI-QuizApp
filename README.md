# General Quiz Game (PyQt6)

This Python script creates a simple general knowledge quiz game using the PyQt6 library for the graphical user interface.  The game presents users with 10 multiple-choice questions and tracks their score.

## Features

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built using PyQt6, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.
*   **Multiple-Choice Questions:**  Presents users with multiple-choice questions, where they must select the correct answer.
*   **Score Tracking:** Tracks the player's score throughout the game.
*   **Randomized Questions:** Questions are randomly selected from a predefined set.
*   **Game Over Screen:** Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.
*   **Help Screen:** Provides instructions on how to play the game.
*   **Play Again:** Allows the user to play the quiz again after finishing.
*   **Styling:** Basic styling is applied to the GUI elements for a better look and feel.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   PyQt6 library. Install it using: `pip install PyQt6`

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `quiz_game.py`).
2.  **Define Questions:**  Before running the script, you *must* add your quiz questions and answers.  Locate the `questions_and_answers` dictionary in the code and populate it with your questions. The format is:

    ```python
    questions_and_answers = {
        "Your Question 1": ("Correct Answer", ["Wrong Answer 1", "Wrong Answer 2", "Wrong Answer 3"]),
        "Your Question 2": ("Correct Answer", ["Wrong Answer 1", "Wrong Answer 2", "Wrong Answer 3"]),
        # ... more questions
    }
    ```

    Make sure you have at least 10 questions for the game to function as intended.
3.  **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the script using `python quiz_game.py`.
4.  **Play the game:** Use the buttons to select your answers. Your score will be displayed in the top right corner. The game ends after 10 questions.  Click "Play Again" to start a new game.  Click "Help" for instructions.

## Code Explanation

*   **`Ui_MainWindow` Class:** This class is generated by PyQt's designer tool (or coded directly) and sets up the GUI elements (labels, buttons, etc.). It handles the layout and appearance of the window.
*   **`retranslateUi` Function:**  Sets the text displayed on the GUI elements.
*   **Button Click Events:** The code connects button clicks to specific functions (e.g., `play_button_clicked`, `check_answer`).
*   **`play_button_clicked` Function:** Initializes the game state (score, question count) and starts a new game.
*   **`help_button` Function:** Displays the help text in the `textEdit` widget.
*   **`extit_button_clicked` Function:** Hides the help text.
*   **`check_answer` Function:** Checks if the user's selected answer is correct, updates the score, and loads the next question.
*   **`load_next_question` Function:** Randomly selects a question, sets the question text in the label, shuffles the answer options, and sets the text on the answer buttons.  It also handles the "game over" logic.
*   **`questions_and_answers` Dictionary:**  This dictionary (which you MUST populate) stores the questions and their corresponding correct and incorrect answers.

## Example `questions_and_answers`

```python
questions_and_answers = {
    "What is the capital of France?": ("Paris", ["London", "Berlin", "Madrid"]),
    "What is the highest mountain in the world?": ("Mount Everest", ["K2", "Kangchenjunga", "Lhotse"]),
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": ("Jupiter", ["Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]),
    # ... add at least 7 more questions!
}
